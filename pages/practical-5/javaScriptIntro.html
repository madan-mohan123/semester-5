            <span style="color: orangered;">JavaScript </span>: JavaScript (js) is a light-weight object-oriented programming language which is used by several websites for scripting the webpages.
             It is an interpreted, full-fledged programming language that enables dynamic interactivity on websites when applied to an HTML 
             document. It was introduced in the year 1995 for adding programs to the webpages in the Netscape Navigator browser. Since then,
              it has been adopted by all other graphical web browsers. With JavaScript, users can build modern web applications to interact
               directly without reloading the page every time. The traditional website uses js to provide several forms of interactivity and 
               simplicity.
Although, Js has no connectivity with Java programming language. The name was suggested and provided in the times when Java was gaining
 popularity in the market. In addition to web browsers, databases such as CouchDB and MongoDB uses JavaScript as their scripting and query language.
